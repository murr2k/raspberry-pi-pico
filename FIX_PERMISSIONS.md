# 🔧 Fix USB Permissions for Full Automation

## 🎯 Current Status: 99% Complete!

Your automated flashing system is working perfectly - we just need to fix USB permissions for the final step.

## 🚀 Solution: Run These Commands

**Copy and paste these commands in your terminal:**

```bash
# 1. Create the udev rule file
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-pico.rules > /dev/null << 'EOF'
# Raspberry Pi Pico BOOTSEL mode
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0003", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess"

# Raspberry Pi Pico running mode
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000a", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess"

# Generic RP2040 devices
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess"
EOF

# 2. Reload udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# 3. Add your user to dialout group (already done, but just in case)
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

echo "✅ USB permissions fixed!"
```

## 🔄 After Running the Commands

**Reconnect your Pico:**
1. In Windows PowerShell (Admin): `usbipd detach --busid 2-7`
2. Put Pico back in BOOTSEL mode (hold button while connecting)
3. In Windows PowerShell (Admin): `usbipd attach --wsl --busid 2-7`

**Test the automation:**
```bash
cd raspberry-pi-pico/examples/c
make flash-auto TARGET=blinky
```

## 🎉 Expected Result

After fixing permissions, you should see:
```bash
🚀 Starting automated flash process...
✅ Pico found in bootloader mode
✅ Firmware loaded successfully  
✅ Pico rebooted to run new firmware
🎉 Automated flashing successful!
```

And your Pico's LED should start blinking! 💫

## 🔧 Alternative: Test with Sudo (Temporary)

If you want to test immediately without changing permissions:
```bash
# Test that everything works with sudo
sudo picotool load build/blinky.uf2
sudo picotool reboot
```

This should flash your firmware and make the LED blink, proving the entire system works.

## 📊 What You've Achieved
